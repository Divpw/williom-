# This file makes Python treat the directory william_ai_assistant as a package.

# You can optionally define what gets imported when someone does `from william_ai_assistant import *`
# For example:
# __all__ = ["main", "config", "audio_listener", "william_brain", "system_commands", "tts_engine"]

# Or pre-import modules to make them available at the package level, e.g.:
# from . import config
# from . import tts_engine

# For now, keeping it simple. The primary purpose is to mark the directory as a package.
print("William AI Assistant package initialized.")
